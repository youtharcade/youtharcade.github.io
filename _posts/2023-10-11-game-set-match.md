This is a general thought - I've been trying to work harder to organize my life and as a result I've been reading a lot of different books on the subject. One such as "The Para Method" by Tiago Forte is pretty helpful, however trying to move everything and get used to actually following the method is a bit difficult for me as I cling to habits pretty hard and have a hard time breaking them.

I'm trying to figure out how to create some kind of Game Journal using Python. My idea is I can put in data on what I played for the day with the Title/Console/Time and use it to get some kind of info on my playing habits. Maybe have an option where I can choose if I've beaten said game or not. Ultimately I'd like to create some kind of macOS/iOS/iPadOS app that I could not only store my entire library with metadata included but also a journal as well. I've seen a lot of apps do one but not the other or minimally add those sorts of features.

The other idea I have is to write something for this site that keeps track of my game play stuff. I think having it looks like a physical library with all the Switch spines and when you click on it you get details of the game/my gameplay could be neat.

Finally, I was able to figure out how to utilize iOS Shortcuts to create a Pok√©mon Chart so I can ask Siri for Strength/Weaknesses and stuff. It's still a work in progress but the prototype worked without issue. Maybe next post I'll go into how I got it working.
